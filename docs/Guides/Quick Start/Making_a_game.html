<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Making a game</h1><br/>It’s already a pretty colossal task to make a game but making a game in an unknown engine is even harder. To help with that we’ll go through the basic asset creation needed to make a game. For more in depth information you can check the official guide <a href="https://wargamer3.github.io/Project-Eternity/">here</a>.<br /><br />This tutorial will teach you about:       <br />1. Creating Unit/Pilot/Attacks<br />2. Creating a map<br />3. Creating dialogues<br />4.  Creating cutscenes<br />5. Creating animations (Optional)<br /><br />After doing all of this you’ll have a fully working stage and you’ll be able to start tying them together to make a proper story.<br />The order of asset creation is not important, you can easily split the work between multiple people without getting blocked anywhere if you use placeholders where needed.<br /><br />This tutorial will follow the creation of a demo for SRWE so you can follow it by using any <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fysuf794cxnm820/SRWE%20Everything%20demo.zip?dl=0">demo</a>.</div>
