<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Pros and Cons</h1><br/><h2>Pros</h2><br />• It is entirely free and open source and is specialized in SRW gameplay. Some other engines like SRPG studio are designed around Fire Emblem gameplay. The only proper SRW engine is SRC but is not in english.<br />• It has many built-in precoded features from SRW from various eras. Squad system, terrain bonuses, barriers, MAP attacks, multi-units and others.<br />• Being an open source toolbox, it allows for significant flexibility with extensions by just dropping new dlls. You can add new AI scripts, skill effects, unit types, cutscene actions, etc. You can also just create entirely new mods that reuse those tools to make something like a shooter, and advance war clone, etc.<br />• It is very light-weight, able to run on computers as old as Windows 7, and file sizes are very small allowing for easy distribution. Could be ported back to XP if needed.<br />• It is meant to be a community effort so it has all the content of SRWE available free to use. Sprites, animations, tiletsets, AI, etc.<br /><br /><h2>Cons</h2><br />• Being based on XNA, you need some workaround to make it work with visual studio if you want to modify the code. It will also require you to compile sprites to use them. (Can be worked around with <a href="https://github.com/TEdit/Terraria-Map-Editor/releases">TEdit</a>)<br />• With the exception of units and characters, games are constructed entirely through the use editors so you can’t easily edit assets with a text editor.<br />• The engine was initially designed by someone with no knowledge of SRW and was inspired by Armored Core and Unreal Tournament, making some editors include non standard SRW features which can be confusing.<br />• At this moment, the Community is very small.</div>
