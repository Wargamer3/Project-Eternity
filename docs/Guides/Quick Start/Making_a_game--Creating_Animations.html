<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Creating Animations</h1><br/><a href=""><img src="images/32-1.png" alt="images/32-1.png" /></a><br />The Animations node contains animations, backgrounds, background sprites, background objects, sprite sheet, bitmap animations and sprites.<br />Just like the Cutscene editor, the Animation editor is a generic editor used by many things, you can delete unused timelines in the Timelines folder.<br />Put the sprites you need into the assets folders needed before starting. We won’t cover backgrounds much but you’ll be fine with sticking to just 2D backgrounds. Backgrounds objects are a fancy collection of sprites you can strap together to give the illusion of 3D. You can then use those inside a 2D background.<br />We’ll explain the editor and then go through the process of creating the basic animations you’d want for a SRW game, Default, Move In, Attack Start, Attack Hit, Attack Miss and Attack Destroy.</div>
