<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Creating Visual Novels</h1><br/><a href=""><img src="images/24-1.png" alt="images/24-1.png" /></a><br />To create dialog you’ll need to use the Visual Novels node. You can see your VN as well as portraits and backgrounds in your Content/Visual Novels folder. Because it’s a standalone editor, it is possible to create VN entirely by hand by handpicking portraits for each dialog but you can also use the characters created before instead.<br />It’s entirely possible to create a non-linear dialog as well, we won’t go into details but we’ll cover it a bit.</div>
